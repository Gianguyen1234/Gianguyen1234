**📢 Introducing My Telegram Bot for Learning English Through News! 📰✨**

Hey everyone! 👋

I’m excited to share something I’ve been working on—a **Telegram bot** designed to help you improve your English while staying updated on the latest news! 🌍 Whether you’re preparing for exams, brushing up on your language skills, or simply love learning, this bot makes the process both engaging and practical.

### 🚀 **Features of the Bot:**

1️⃣ **Daily News Updates**: Subscribe to your favorite categories like sports, health, technology, and more to get daily news summaries.  
2️⃣ **Learn English from Headlines**: Use `/learn` to extract vocabulary from real-world news and get definitions for challenging words.  
3️⃣ **Practice Pronunciation**: With `/pronounce`, the bot sends you an audio file to help you learn the correct pronunciation of any word.  
4️⃣ **Listening Practice**: Use `/listen` to hear news headlines read aloud—perfect for improving your comprehension skills.  
5️⃣ **Customizable Experience**: Subscribe or unsubscribe to categories as you like and access trending news anytime with `/news`.

### 🛠️ **How It Works:**

The bot fetches news from trusted sources using the NewsAPI. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify meaningful vocabulary, and Google Text-to-Speech generates audio for pronunciation and listening exercises.
