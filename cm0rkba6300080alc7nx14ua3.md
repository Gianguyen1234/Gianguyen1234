### **In this article, we'll learn how to implement MVC pattern with Laravel Framework**

### <mark>MVC:</mark>

MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, a widely used architectural pattern in web development. It's a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:

**Model**: Represents the data structures and business logic of the application. It manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

**View**: Handles the visual representation of the data and is responsible for rendering it to the user. Typically, it's an HTML template or a template engine.

**Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives and processes user input, validates data, and interacts with the Model to retrieve data.

### **<mark>Laravel</mark>**:

A popular, object-oriented framework that provides an elegant syntax and a high level of abstraction. Laravel uses the Eloquent ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for data modeling and the Blade template engine for views.

Here's a simple example of implementing the MVC pattern in a Laravel application:

**Step 1: Create the Model**

```php
// app/Models/Book.php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Book extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'author',
        'year',
    ];
}
```

**Step 2: Create the View**

```php
<!-- resources/views/books/index.blade.php -->

<div class="container">
    @foreach ($books as $book)
        <p>{{ $book->title }} ({{ $book->author }})</p>
    @endforeach
</div>
```

**Step 3: Create the Controller**

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/BooksController.php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Models\Book;

class BooksController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $books = Book::paginate(10);
        return view('books.index', compact('books'));
    }
}
```

By following these steps, we've built a simple CRUD system using Laravel.

### Implementing MVC in Laravel: A More Complex Example

**Scenario:** A blog application with posts, comments, and categories.

### 1\. Models

```php
// app/Models/Post.php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    public function comments()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);   
    }

    public function category()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Category::class);   
    }
}

// app/Models/Comment.php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Comment extends Model
{
    public function post()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Post::class);   
    }
}

// app/Models/Category.php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Category extends Model
{
    public function posts()
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Post::class);   
    }
}
```

### 2\. Controllers

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/PostsController.php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PostsController extends Controller
{
    public function   1. medium.com medium.com index()
    {
        $posts = Post::latest()->paginate(10);
        return view('posts.index', compact('posts'));
    }

    public function show(Post $post)
    {
        return view('posts.show', compact('post'));
    }
}

// app/Http/Controllers/CommentsController.php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Models\Comment;
use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class CommentsController extends Controller  
{
    public function store(Request $request, Post $post)
    {
        $comment = new Comment();
        $comment->body = $request->input('body');  
        $comment->post_id = $post->id;
        $comment->save();

        return redirect()->back();
    }
}
```

### 3\. Views

```php
<div class="container">
    @foreach ($posts as $post)
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">{{ $post->title }}</h5>
                <p class="card-text">{{ $post->excerpt }}</p>
                <a href="{{ route('posts.show', $post) }}" class="btn btn-primary">Read more</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    @endforeach
</div>

<div class="container">
    <h1>{{ $post->title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ $post->body }}</p>
    <h3>Comments</h3>
    <ul>
        @foreach ($post->comments as $comment)
            <li>{{ $comment->body }}</li>
        @endforeach
    </ul>
    <form action="{{ route('comments.store', $post) }}" method="POST">
        @csrf
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="body">Comment:</label>
            <textarea class="form-control" id="body" name="body" rows="3"></textarea>
        </div>
        <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>  
    </form>
</div>
```

### Explanation:

* **Models:** Define the relationships between posts, comments, and categories.
    
* **Controllers:** Handle actions related to posts and comments, such as fetching, creating, and displaying data.
    
* **Views:** Render the HTML templates based on the data provided by the controllers.
    

This example demonstrates a more complex MVC structure with relationships between models, multiple controllers, and more intricate view logic. It showcases how Laravel's MVC architecture can be used to build larger and more feature-rich applications.
